# Ford-Go-Bike Trip Data

# Data Set
This data set includes information about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area.
* Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in
order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities
covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need
to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.
* If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding in analysis from
other cities,
* When are most trips taken in terms
of time of day, day of the week, or
month of the year?
* How long does the average trip
take?
* Does the above depend on if a user
* is a subscriber or customer?

# Key Insights for Presentation
In this project,I Focus on  relation of member's age group and gender with their bike usage in terms of duration with variables of questions (user type, user age and gender, weekdays ).
Afterwards I Introduced  of each of categorical variable on by one , translated it to plots to get calrity percentage and make category of ages of users whatever customers and subscribers (with  Them Gender) and compared the age for them with durations and the period .
